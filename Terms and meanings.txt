Merge - Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

Rebase - In Git, the rebase command integrates changes from one branch into another. It is an alternative to the better known "merge" command. Most visibly, rebase differs from merge by rewriting the commit history in order to produce a straight, linear succession of commits.

Revert - The git revert command is a forward-moving undo operation that offers a safe method of undoing changes. Instead of deleting or orphaning commits in the commit history, a revert will create a new commit that inverses the changes specified. Git revert is a safer alternative to git reset in regards to losing work.

Reset - git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo. Git reset operates on "The Three Trees of Git". These trees are the Commit History ( HEAD ), the Staging Index, and the Working Directory.

Stash - The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy.

Squash - Squash is technique in which you bundle up some of your last insignificant or less important commits into a single one.

Tagging - Tags are ref's that point to specific points in Git history. Tagging is generally used to capture a point in history that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1. 0.1). A tag is like a branch that doesn't change. Unlike branches, tags, after being created, have no further history of commits.
